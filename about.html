                <ul>
                    <li>I'm a first-year computer science student at Durham.</li>
                    <li>This is my first meaningful attempt at web development.</li>
                    <li>On that note, every character of code used to build this website was written by me. This is a raw demonstration of my HTML/CSS/JS abilities, without any templates or packages.</li>
                    <li>I am proficient in Python; I have particular experience in working with web APIs & JSON, the Pandas library, and building interfaces (Tkinter & pygame).</li>
                    <li>I still have no idea when "Computer Science" is capitalized or not. Everyone I've asked gives a different answer. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
                    <li>I am addicted to olives. I have a problem and I like having a problem.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>I have a minimal internet presence, but <a href="https://github.com/vrpst"> I do use GitHub.</a>
