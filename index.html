                    <li>I'm a first-year computer science student at Durham.</li>
                    <li>This is my first meaningful attempt at working with HTML and CSS.</li>
                    <li>I have a fair amount of experience using Python; my next project is hopefully going to be converting a game I made with it to work on the web.</li>
                    <li>I still have no idea when "Computer Science" is capitalized or not. Everyone I've asked gives a different answer.</li>
                    <li>Dark chocolate rules.</li>
                </ul>
