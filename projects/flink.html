            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="info-text">Flink (a contraction of <b>f</b>irst <b>link</b>) is a single-player trivia game, written in Python. A user is given a random
            Wikipedia article and has to travel to an unknown destination article by successively guessing the first hyperlinked article on the article they are currently on.
            They are given their current article's first sentence as a hint, and they have an unlimited number of attempts to guess the missing link.
            Once they are correct, they then repeat this on the article they guessed, and keep going until they reach 
            one of the ten "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles/Level/1">Vital Articles</a>".<br><br>
            The game is currently solely a desktop game, but I hope to be able to turn it into a web game, once my JavaScript skills are sufficient.<br><br>
            An overview of some of the technical details of this project is available in the <a href="https://github.com/vrpst/flink/blob/main/technical.md"><code>technical.md</code></a> file.            <h3>Example</h3>
            The first link on the page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><code>HTML</code></a> is 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language"><code>markup language</code></a>, and the first link on that article is
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"><code>code</code></a> (displayed as "text-encoding system"; either would be a valid guess).
            The game gives you the first sentence of the article as a hint: reusing our HTML example, the game would give it to you
            as <code>"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard ______ ________ for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser."</code>
            Various other hints (e.g. revealing all the vowels in a link) are available to help you guess correctly.<br><br>
