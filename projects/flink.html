                <p class="info-text">Flink (a contraction of <b>f</b>irst <b>link</b>) is a single-player trivia game, where a user is given a random
                Wikipedia article. They are given the article's first sentence, and have to continually guess what the first hyperlink on
                the page. They then repeat this on the article they guess, and keep going until they reach one of the ten
                "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles/Level/1">Vital Articles</a>".<br><br>
                As an example, the
                first link on the page <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a></i> is 
                <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a></i>, and the first link on that article is
                <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code">code</a></i> (displayed as "text-encoding system"; either would be a valid guess).
                The game gives you the first sentence of the article as a hint: reusing our <i>HTML</i> example, the game would give it to you
                as "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard ______ ________ for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser."
                Various other hints (e.g. revealing all the vowels in a link) are available to help you guess correctly.<br><br>
                The game is currently solely a desktop Python game, but I hope to be able to turn it into a web game, once my JavaScript skills are sufficient.

                <h2>Technical overview</h2>
                <p class="info-text">The path to get from the starting article to the finishing one is found by querying the Wikimedia API for the starting page's
                    text, running it through a parser algorithm to find the first link, and repeating this recusively until one of the Vital 
                    Articles is reached, or the path loops (i.e. article A's first link is article B, and article B's first link is article A).
                    At the same time as the first link is found in the page text, the parser also finds and formats the first sentence of the article.
                    All API queries and parsing is carried out on a loading screen, before the game begins.<br><br>
                    The parser makes up the bulk of the project's backend. I wrote it before I knew regex to any usable capacity, so it makes use of
                    native Python string-matching techniques. This includes filtering templates, citations/references, and wikitext
                    bold/italic/underline syntax. Finding the first link is generally straightforward—find the first word enclosed in double square
                    brackets ("[[example]]") <i>not</i> in a template or reference.
                    Finding and accurately fixing the first sentence is made much more complicated by the many different ways a full stop/period can
                    be used, as well as natural variations in formatting that occur when humans write text. I would estimate that the sentence parsing
                    has around a 95% success rate, so it is (infuriatingly!) not perfect.<br><br>
                    The frontend is written using the Pygame library and involved using it to much greater depth than I had ever done previously. 
                    The entire interface is inside a big while loop, with a status variable shifting between the game states (loading, running, end) and the 
                    different screens (home, howtoplay, about, game). Pygame does not have native button support, and I had to write classes to function 
                    as button objects from scratch, as well as creating my own text input functionality. The loading screen makes use of multithreading 
                    to maintain the animations while the backend makes and parses the API calls; if the loading screen froze, it might give the impression 
                    that the game is crashing.<br>
