                <p class="info-text">Flink (a contraction of <b>f</b>irst <b>link</b>) is a single-player trivia game, where a user is given a random
                Wikipedia article and has to guess their way to an unknown destination article. They are given each article's first sentence, and have to continually 
                guess what the first hyperlink on the page is. Once they are correct, they then repeat this on the article they guessed, and keep going until they reach 
                one of the ten "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles/Level/1">Vital Articles</a>".<br><br>
                As an example, the first link on the page <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a></i> is 
                <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a></i>, and the first link on that article is
                <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code">code</a></i> (displayed as "text-encoding system"; either would be a valid guess).
                The game gives you the first sentence of the article as a hint: reusing our <i>HTML</i> example, the game would give it to you
                as "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard ______ ________ for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser."
                Various other hints (e.g. revealing all the vowels in a link) are available to help you guess correctly.<br><br>
                The game is currently solely a desktop Python game, but I hope to be able to turn it into a web game, once my JavaScript skills are sufficient.<br><br>
                An overview of some of the technical details of this project is available in the <a href="https://github.com/vrpst/flink/blob/main/technical.md"><code>technical.md</code></a> file.
