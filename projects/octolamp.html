            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                Octolamp is a interactive data visualisation tool for United Kingdom local elections.
                It uses the <a href="https://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> JavaScript library in conjunction with the Office for National Statistics'
                <a href="https://www.data.gov.uk/search?q=Local+Authority+Districts+%28December&filters%5Bpublisher%5D=Office+for+National+Statistics&filters%5Btopic%5D=&filters%5Bformat%5D=GEOJSON&sort=best">
                GeoJSON data of local authority boundaries</a>
                 to render three vector maps of different tiers of UK local government authorities, which are then colored in using a JavaScript function that runs on the results data.
                 The GeoJSON data uses different EPSG projections depending on when it was released, so I created <a href="https://github.com/vrpst/espg-converter">a converter</a> to handle this.
                A box in the top right shows a chart (via <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">ChartJS</a>) and a table with more information on the selected election result.
                <br><br>
                The results data visualised is made up of a series of JSON files. These are generated from datasets compiled by the House of Commons Library. The HOCL provides
                these datasets in the CSV format—I wrote a series of Python scripts to convert the data into the JSON that Octolamp uses.
            </p>
